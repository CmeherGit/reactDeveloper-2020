#Complete React Developer 2020

### React Concepts

React around the concept of reusable components.

### single page applications

- single page applications helps to reduce loading time of webpage.
- single page replace component when it is needed not load whole page again.

### Fetching content

- lifecycle methods are automatically react.

###

- Anything in between component tag is children.
- break program into simple small components

### The job of a react developer

- 1. Decide on components
  - State v/s Props
- 2. Decide the state and where it lives
  - when the state changes then the state using components only changing.
- 3. What changes when state changes

### Rect components advantages

- Wsse can use same component for multiple uses and multiple data processing.
- We can reuse components for multiple datas processing(resusable smaller components).
- The component name must show exactly what it does.
- Flexibility of performance improvement.
- components are easy to test and find bugs quickly.

###

- setState is asyncronous funciton call, thats why the search button return the state(searchField state in this program) value one letter behind.

### asyncronous and syncronous function call

- synchornous funciton call something we can expect to happen almost immediatly.js for wait continuesly to finish syncronous funciton call.
- asyncrounos action or events is something is actually takes definite amount of time javascript does not know.its actually runs the rest of the code after and then when the asyncronous event finishes it then run that finished events.

### synthetic events

- synthetic events is like a fake events it pretents react events

### array methods

- filter - for filtering items from an array,includes - check the given string is include in array item(take and compare each array elements).

### functional component

- They dont have access to state and constructor. They also dont have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.
- Sometimes we need to render some html only.
- Functional component get some props and return an html.
